## Self-hosted Setup
To host this application yourself, the only supported option at this time is via `docker compose`.

1. Clone this repo your docker host.
1. In a terminal window, navigate to the cloned repo.
1. Create `.env` file, by running: `echo "ATM_MACHINE_TOKEN_SECRET=$(head --bytes=256 /dev/urandom | base64 --wrap=0)" > .env`
1. Run: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build`
1. If successful, app will be available at: `http://<your-docker-host>:8090`

## Dev Setup
In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine. 
- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)

In the first terminal
```
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
```

In the second terminal (*in the project root directory (back-end))

```
$ cd server
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
```

- Create a file named `.env`, in the `server` directory.
- Supply the following credentials
```
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=<address to mongo db>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<secret key, see below>
```

You can generate a secret key using node. Enter the below command in the terminal to genrate a random secret key:
```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"
```

Save the `.env` file and run:
```
$ npm start
```
